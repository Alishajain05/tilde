# tilde

A material design new tab/homepage based off of [cadejscroggins' tilde startpage](https://cadejscroggins.github.io/tilde/) and [vishumad's material startpage](https://www.github.com/vishnumad/material-tilde).

A few quotes chosen from [abhn's personal blog repo](https://github.com/abhn/abhn.github.io).
[LIVE DEMO](http://darth-dodo.github.io/tilde/)

**Usage:**

It's pretty simple. To go to a site you just enter the corresponding key. To view the available commands, enter a `?`. If your input doesn't match any of the commands, a generic google search will be triggered.

**Examples:**

```
amazon                # takes you to amazon.in
github: Django        # searches GitHub for Django
apples                # searches google for apples
```

Help me make it better or create your own starter page! ^_^
